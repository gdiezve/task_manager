# Task Manager app

This is a simple Django application that allows you to create, modify and delete tasks from an SQLite database (you will find it inside **/django_app** directory as **db.sqlite3**). Also, you will be able to get a list of all the existing tasks.

Django REST framework brings an easy way to build the backend of an application with good error handling.

Before running the app, you will need to install ```django``` and ```djangorestframework``` packages; this project includes a **requirements.txt** file to help you installing this packages. It is necessary to have installed ```python```and ```pip``` in your system; then, you can create a virtual environment and install the project dependecies by executing the following command from the root directory of this repository:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

In order to properly run this app, it is necessary to download or clone this repository and execute the following command from inside **django_app** directory:

```` python manage.py runserver````

Then from localhost:8000/tasks endpoint you will be able to manage any task through Django REST framework. You will see something like this:

The new task will be created with the information and an ID.
